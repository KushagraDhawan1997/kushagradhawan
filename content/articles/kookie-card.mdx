Kookie UI is a fork of Radix Themes. Most components have been adjusted to fit the design language and patterns I needed.

Card is one of those components.

The Radix Themes Card is solid. Three variants (surface, classic, ghost), five sizes, support for `asChild` to make the whole card interactive. It handles the basics well.

But I kept running into situations where it wasn't quite right. Needed a border without a background fill. Wanted translucent cards with backdrop blur. Had images that needed to fill edge-to-edge. The workarounds were getting repetitive.

So I extended it.

<Box mt="9">
  <PreviewBlock
    height="28rem"
    showThemeToggle={false}
    appearance="dark"
    variant="ghost"
    background={{
      backgroundImage: `url(${IMAGE_URL})`,
      backgroundSize: "cover",
      backgroundPosition: "center",
    }}
  >
    <Card variant="classic" material="translucent" size="3" style={{ maxWidth: 320 }}>
      <Flex direction="column" gap="6">
        <Flex direction="column" gap="3">
          <HugeiconsIcon icon={Book02Icon} size={24} strokeWidth={1.75} />
          <Heading size="5" weight="medium">
            Getting Started
          </Heading>
          <Text size="2" color="gray">

          </Text>
        </Flex>
        <Button variant="solid" size="2" color="gray" highContrast>

          <HugeiconsIcon icon={ArrowRight01Icon} strokeWidth={1.75} />
        </Button>
      </Flex>
    </Card>
  </PreviewBlock>
</Box>

## What Changed

### Two New Variants

Radix gives you surface, classic, and ghost. I added **outline** and **soft**.

**Outline** is transparent with a visible border. No background color, just boundaries. It's now the default because it works in more contexts without fighting the layout.

```tsx
<Card variant="outline">
  <Text>Border only, no background fill</Text>
</Card>
```

**Soft** is a muted background without a border. Subtle grouping when you want something between invisible (ghost) and fully bounded (outline/surface).

```tsx
<Card variant="soft">
  <Text>Muted background, no border</Text>
</Card>
```

### Material System

Modern UIs create depth through blur, not just shadows. The `material` prop controls this.

```tsx
<Card material="translucent">
  <Text>Backdrop blur with semi-transparent background</Text>
</Card>
```

When `material="translucent"`, the card gets `backdrop-filter: blur()` and uses `color-mix()` for semi-transparent backgrounds. The effect is subtle but creates layering that feels lighter than drop shadows.

This works at two levels. Set it on your theme and all cards inherit it. Override it per-card when you need solid backgrounds for performance or readability.

Every variant handles translucency correctly. Surface, outline, classic, ghost, soft. They all adapt their colors and borders for both solid and translucent materials.

### Edge-to-Edge Content

Two props for content that needs to break out of the card's padding.

**`inset`** removes padding but keeps the border radius. Perfect for image cards where you want the photo to fill the container but still have rounded corners.

```tsx
<Card inset>
  <img src="/hero.jpg" alt="Full bleed image with rounded corners" />
</Card>
```

**`flush`** is for ghost cards inside containers. It applies negative margins so the card's content aligns with the parent's edges instead of being inset by the card's own padding.

```tsx
<Card variant="ghost" flush>
  <Text>Aligns with parent container edges</Text>
</Card>
```

## The Full API

| Prop | Type | Default | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ------- | ----------- |
| `size` | `'1' \| '2' \| '3' \| '4' \| '5'` | `'1'` | Padding and spacing. Responsive. |
| `variant` | `'surface' \| 'outline' \| 'classic' \| 'ghost' \| 'soft'` | `'outline'` | Visual style. |
| `material` | `'solid' \| 'translucent'` | — | Backdrop blur and transparency. |
| `inset` | `boolean` | `false` | Zero padding, keeps radius. |
| `flush` | `boolean` | `false` | Negative margins for ghost cards. |
| `asChild` | `boolean` | `false` | Render as child element. |

## Why These Changes

Every enhancement came from real usage.

**Outline as default.** Surface imposes a background. In complex layouts with multiple cards, backgrounds stack and create visual noise. Outline defines boundaries without adding weight. It's a safer default.

**Soft variant.** Sometimes you need subtle grouping but borders feel heavy. Ghost is invisible. Surface and outline are too pronounced. Soft fills that gap.

**Material system.** Floating panels, overlays, modal-like interfaces. Translucent cards with blur create depth without the heaviness of shadows. The hierarchy feels more natural.

**Inset and flush.** Image cards and ghost cards inside containers. These are common patterns. Having props for them beats repeating the same CSS overrides.

## What Stayed the Same

The foundation is unchanged. Card is still a styled container that wraps content. It still uses Radix's prop extraction system. It still supports `asChild` for interactive cards. It still works with margin props.

If you're coming from Radix Themes, Card works the same way. The new props are additive. The variant change (outline instead of surface as default) is the only breaking difference, and it's a one-line fix if you need surface.

## Closing

Forking a design system creates maintenance burden. Every upstream change needs evaluation. The goal is to fork as little as possible while getting the flexibility you need.

Card needed more variants, a material system, and props for edge cases. These additions let you build interfaces without fighting the component. That's the bar for extending upstream: if you're working around the component more than with it, extend it.
