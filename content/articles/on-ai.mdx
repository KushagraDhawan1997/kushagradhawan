AI gets plenty of criticism. But for all its flaws, it's **leveling the playing field** in a way I haven't seen before.

## The barrier is lower

You can now just ship things. It has never been more true.

I studied **engineering**, started as a designer, and for years barely wrote any code. Then **AI changed that**. I can now actually build what I want, prototype fast, contribute to code at work, and turn ideas into real products.

The traditional path used to be: learn for years, then maybe build something. Now it's: have an idea, start building, learn as you go. The tool fills the gaps while you're still figuring things out.

## It's not about replacing skill

AI doesn't replace taste, judgment, or understanding what makes something good. Those still matter—maybe more than before. What it does is remove the years of syntax memorization and boilerplate writing that kept people from even starting.

I still need to know what I want. I still need to understand structure, performance, user experience. But I don't need to remember every API method or fight with configuration files for hours. That friction is mostly gone.

## Faster cycles mean better products

When you can go from idea to working prototype in hours instead of weeks, you learn faster. You test assumptions sooner. You catch bad ideas before investing months into them.

At work, this changes how we build. Features that would've needed careful planning and specialist developers can now be sketched out, tested with users, and iterated on before committing to a full implementation. The feedback loop is tighter.

## What this means

The gap between "I wish this existed" and "here's a working version" is smaller than it's ever been. That's powerful for anyone who wants to make things but didn't have the traditional path to get there.

I just love **making stuff**, and AI lets me do more of it. That's pretty cool.
