## Product Strategy That Adapts

Product strategy works best when it builds systems that adapt to change rather than trying to predict the future. At Womp, we grew from beta to 500K users by making strategic choices that compound over time.

When transitioning from Womp 3.0 to 4.0, we focused on creating a platform that becomes more valuable as it grows, not just managing feature lists. We made decisions that serve both immediate user needs and long-term competitive positioning.

## Cross-Functional Team Leadership

Leading Design, Frontend, and QA teams at Womp has shown that breakthrough products happen when disciplines truly collaborate. My background in both Computer Science and design helps bridge communication gaps between teams.

Instead of managing tasks, we create conditions where great work happens naturally. Teams get clarity on outcomes, not just deliverables. People make better decisions independently when they understand why their work matters.

We maintained the energy and quality of a tight-knit team while scaling to hundreds of thousands of users. People stay engaged because they see their ideas become reality, and challenges turn into collaborative opportunities.

## Scaling Complex Technical Products

Most 3D design tools fail because they're built by engineers for engineers. We took Womp to 500K users by making sophisticated technology accessible to everyone.

We ship continuously, learn quickly, and adjust based on what users actually do, not what they say they want. This combines speed with intelligent iteration.

Making complex technology mainstream requires rethinking fundamental assumptions about how tools should work. When you solve this well, scale follows naturally.

## Engineering Meets Design Thinking

The best products emerge when technical possibility meets human needs without compromise. My computer science background helps us understand what's technically possible, while design experience ensures we build something people want to use.

At Womp, we built advanced features like real-time ray tracing that feel intuitive to non-technical users. The challenge isn't just making things work—it's making complex technology feel obvious.

Working across both domains means we prototype, design, and ship with fewer translation errors between disciplines. Moving fluidly between technical implementation and user experience creates products that competitors find hard to copy.

## Building Systems That Last

Throughout my journey from writing code to leading product teams, I've focused on creating systems that outlive individual projects. The processes, team dynamics, and technical decisions we make contribute to sustainable success.

Whether developing talent, improving team communication, or finding elegant solutions to complex problems, the goal is always building something that makes the organization stronger—not just shipping the next feature.
