## Professional Background

I'm a Product Manager and Design Lead specializing in early-stage startups. My expertise lies in 0-to-1 product development, scaling products to reach 500K+ users, and achieving product-market fit through rapid iteration.

At Womp3D, I've led product and design since joining as the first design hire in 2021. I built the foundation for what would become a significant player in the 3D design space. After establishing the product direction and design systems, I progressed to Design Lead in 2022, building the design team and coordinating with engineering to integrate new features.

Currently, I serve as Product Manager and Design Lead, focusing on building Womp's AI Suite with GenAI, LLM, and MCP technologies to democratize 3D design. Under my leadership, we've scaled from 0 to 500K users and built a sustainable subscription business.

Before Womp3D, I worked at WishboxStudio as a UX Designer and Junior Designer, where I managed client projects and balanced business needs with technical constraints.

My computer science background from BML Munjal University (B.Tech, 2015-2019) gives me a technical foundation that informs my product and design decisions.

## Bringing Teams Together

I help different teams understand each other. Developers, designers, and business people typically speak different languages. I translate technical concepts for non-technical stakeholders and explain business needs to engineers, ensuring everyone understands project goals.

At Womp, I lead Design, Engineering, and QA teams, creating an environment where cross-functional collaboration happens by default. This approach works particularly well with advanced technologies like our AI integration. When everyone understands both what we're building and why, teams move faster and build better products.

## Creating Systems That Last

I build processes that outlast initial projects. Instead of just fixing immediate problems, I develop systematic approaches that simplify future work.

My systems include decision frameworks that reduce recurring debates, communication protocols that survive team changes, and technical architectures with long-term flexibility. These systems have been crucial for Womp's growth, allowing us to scale rapidly while maintaining product quality.

## Helping People Grow

I help team members take on challenges they didn't think they could handle. By identifying hidden strengths and creating opportunities to use them, team members develop new skills and confidence.

I focus on explaining the reasoning behind decisions, not just what to do. When people understand the thinking process, they solve similar problems independently. This creates stronger, more adaptable teams.

## Understanding All Sides

I approach problems from multiple perspectives. While most people specialize in one area, I understand technical constraints, design principles, business needs, and user requirements simultaneously.

This broader perspective leads to better solutions. Instead of choices that satisfy one group at the expense of others, I find approaches that work for all stakeholders. This skill has been particularly valuable in AI product development, where technical limitations, user experience, and business goals must align for success.

## Making Sense of Complexity

When projects get complicated and deadlines loom, I bring clarity. I determine what needs to happen and in what order, turning overwhelming challenges into manageable steps.

At Womp, I've navigated resource constraints while creating scalable foundations and maintaining technical quality. I transform complex requirements into clear, actionable plans that teams can execute efficiently.

Today's biggest product challenges require more than isolated technical skills or design talentâ€”they need seamless integration across disciplines. I help teams build products that work technically, make business sense, and truly help customers.
