# About Kookie AI

Kookie AI is a UX-first, desktop web product where conversations live as a branching graph of nodes ‚Äî each branch can diverge, transform, or produce artifacts ‚Äî giving knowledge workers and creators a powerful OS for exploring, remixing, and producing with AI.

## The Problem with Current AI Tools

Most AI tools today treat conversations as linear, scroll-based experiences. You ask a question, get an answer, ask a follow-up, and the conversation flows in one direction. This works for simple queries, but it breaks down when you're doing complex, creative work.

**ChatGPT** ‚Üí linear, scroll-based.  
**LangFlow / Flowise** ‚Üí dev tools for pipelines, not user-facing.  
**BranchGPT / TalkTree** ‚Üí branching chats, but no atomic tools/artifacts.

## Our Differentiation

**Kookie AI** ‚Üí Conversation graphs (branch anywhere).  
Atomic processing nodes (summarise, translate, extract).  
Artifacts as first-class nodes.  
UX-first, creative/professional user target.

## Core Concept

Kookie AI is a desktop-first, web-based product where conversations are not linear scrolls, but nodes in a branching graph.

Each node = a conversation container (multi-turn chat) or, if left at one prompt ‚Üí atomic interaction.

Users can branch at any point in a conversation, creating alternate paths, explorations, or transformations.

Branches can be:
- **Conversational** (continue dialogue in a new direction)
- **Atomic** (summarise, translate, generate artifact)

üëâ The product is a conversation OS: a map of knowledge, exploration, and creative outputs, not just a chat box.

## Target Audience

- **Knowledge workers** ‚Üí researchers, analysts, consultants
- **Creatives** ‚Üí writers, designers, storytellers  
- **Teams** ‚Üí collaboration, remixing, alternative explorations
- **Power users** of ChatGPT/Gemini who want more control and organization

Not everyday casual users ‚Üí this is closer to Notion / Obsidian / Figma-level power tool.

## UX Principles

### Canvas-First
Pan/zoom workspace with nodes connected visually. This isn't just a chat interface ‚Äî it's a workspace for thinking and creating.

### Branch Anywhere
Right-click a message ‚Üí "branch from here." Unlike linear conversations, you can explore multiple directions from any point.

### Chat Inside Nodes
Rich text, markdown, code, tables, images. Each node is a full conversation container, not just a single message.

### Atomic Transforms
Branch to summary, outline, translation, etc. These aren't just prompts ‚Äî they're first-class processing units that can be chained and reused.

### Link / Unlink
Reorganize nodes (detach, re-attach, cross-pollinate). You're not locked into the original conversation structure ‚Äî you can evolve it as your understanding grows.

### Artifacts
Outputs (tables, docs, images) are first-class and attachable to nodes. They become part of your knowledge system, not just temporary results.

üëâ Users don't think in Git terms (rebase, merge). They think in stories, remixes, save points, and alternate paths.

## Node Types

### Conversation Node
Multi-turn chats with memory/history. Can evolve from atomic.

### Atomic Node
One-shot transform. E.g. Summarise, Translate, Outline, Action Items, Generate Image. Can be silent (output only flows downstream).

### Artifact Node
Holds structured outputs: tables, charts, docs, images, code. Branchable for remix.

üëâ But technically, all nodes are the same object. It's the interaction pattern that defines whether a node is atomic or conversational.

## Branching & Graph Behavior

### Branching
From any message ‚Üí create new conversation node or atomic transform. Branch = "what if?" or "process this so far."

### Detaching
A branch can be promoted into an independent root. Used for restructuring, sharing, or cleaning context.

### Re-attaching
A branch can connect to a different node. Options: inherit new parent's context or just link visually for organization.

üëâ This creates a living, editable conversation graph: a tree that can be pruned, grafted, remixed.

## Key Features

### Branchable Chats
Fork conversations at any point. Explore multiple continuations.

### Atomic Branches
- Summarise until here
- Translate until here  
- Extract tasks/insights
- Format into table/JSON
- Generate images/diagrams

### Artifacts
Outputs (tables, docs, code, visuals) become standalone nodes. Branch further from artifacts.

### Search & Recall
AI-assisted search across nodes. Semantic search for "where did I talk about X?"

### Multi-Model Support
Branch into GPT-4, Gemini, Claude from the same root. Compare outputs.

## Technical Architecture

**Frontend:**
- React + Kookie UI (design system)
- React Flow for canvas visualization
- Rich chat renderer (markdown, code, images)

**Backend:**
- API orchestrator for OpenAI, Gemini, Anthropic
- Postgres/Firebase for storing nodes/messages/artifacts
- Optional vector DB (pgvector, Pinecone) for semantic recall

**LLM Layer:**
- AI-SDK for chat streaming, history, tool calling
- Direct APIs for atomic nodes (summarise, translate, image)
- LangChain (optional) only for advanced nodes (web search, RAG, SQL)

## MVP Roadmap

### Phase 1 (MVP, ~3‚Äì4 months)
- Canvas UI with nodes/branches
- Conversation nodes with branching
- Atomic nodes (Summarise, Translate, Outline)
- Artifact nodes for summaries/tables/images
- Multi-model choice (OpenAI + Gemini)

### Phase 2
- Search across nodes
- Detach/re-attach branches
- Advanced atomic nodes (web search, RAG)
- Export artifacts (MDX, CSV, DOCX)

### Phase 3
- Collaboration (shared graphs)
- Multi-modal artifacts (audio, video)
- Plugin ecosystem (custom atomic nodes)
- Memory nodes (persistent knowledge)

## Pricing Model

**Free**
- Limited nodes/month
- GPT-3.5/Gemini Flash only

**Pro ($15/mo)**
- Unlimited branching
- Access to GPT-4, Gemini Pro, Claude
- Atomic nodes & artifacts
- Generous token allowance

**Team ($30/user/mo)**
- Shared graphs
- Knowledge base search
- Advanced nodes (RAG, DB)

üëâ Positioned like Notion or Obsidian, not "another chatbot."

## Brand & Story

**Name:** Kookie AI (personal, approachable ‚Äî named after your dog üê∂)

**Tone:** Playful on the surface, serious power underneath

**Positioning:** "Not a chatbot. A conversation OS."
