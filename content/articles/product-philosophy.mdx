I build to learn. Along the way I picked up design, engineering, and product the way you pick up ingredients when you learn to cook. The goal stays the same: shorten the path from idea to something people use.

This is the approach I bring to [Womp](https://womp.com) and the reason I created KookieUI.
It's a working set of habits that helps the team move with clarity and keep the product coherent.

## AI first, creator led

AI moves the start line closer to the finish line. For Womp, it gives people a new on-ramp into 3D: generate an object in seconds, then place it, tweak it, and print it. Newcomers get momentum; experienced creators keep depth and control. Faster starts mean more cycles of taste, judgment, and intent—where the human work lives.

## Cross-functional ownership creates speed

The person with the most context carries the work from idea to live. Graphics engineers ship the small frontend panels tied to rendering and experiments they run. Platform and backend engineers build thin UIs that sit on their services. I handle design, work in Figma, and make last-mile polish commits so frontend stays on core architecture and performance, and designers stay focused on problem-solving.

Clear ownership, quick reviews, and tight feedback compress the loop. Fewer handoffs. More progress.

## Consistency lives in KookieUI

The interface stays consistent by putting UI rules in one place. I built **KookieUI**, a Radix UI fork tuned to how the product gets built. Product code imports components like `Button`. Tokens, states, and interactions live inside the system. When spacing or motion changes, I update KookieUI and publish a new version; frontend bumps the package and the app adopts the standard automatically.

This separation keeps design decisions durable and lets engineers focus on logic and performance. For this engagement I act as the design engineer—writing components, setting tokens, reviewing usage, and shipping updates through the package—so polish arrives with speed.

## Ship to learn

The team releases MVPs that cover the happy path and measures real pull. Interviews, dashboards, and usage patterns guide what grows and what stops. Reliability, performance, error handling, and smoke tests keep the bar steady. For AI-heavy areas, the focus is on preserving the quality of generative features and the help bot, maintaining speed, and keeping user intent clear.

A recent example: **AI scene manipulation**. Today it changes materials and moves objects with a small scope by design. The team watches sessions and interviews to decide where to scale it next.

I drive this loop end to end—timelines, product decisions, design work, and final touches in code through KookieUI—so the team can stay deep on the hard parts while the product keeps learning.

## Closing

Start fast with AI. Turn context into speed through shared ownership. Keep pace and polish with a strong system. Ship small to find the pull. That's how I approach the work for Womp: fewer handoffs, tighter loops, and a product that stays clear as it grows.
