I sometimes think about how easily happiness can arise. At our core, I believe we’re all builders—and when we create something that makes someone pause, take a breath, and smile, that’s when we truly feel happy.

That tiny shift from confusion to clarity is what excites me—the moment when you've built something and then watch someone use it. That’s why I learned just enough design to shape the feel, just enough engineering to realize the change, and just enough product thinking to keep us focused on the right problem. I work at the intersection of these three disciplines because that's where the work becomes meaningful and the choices truly matter.

## How I got here

I studied computer science, but I kept gravitating toward the aspects of software that evoke feeling—design, friction, and trust. At [Wishbox Studio](https://wishboxstudio.com), working on a small team meant that one day I would be sketching flows, the next day speaking with clients, and every day juggling many different things in my head. That was my first experience at the intersection of disciplines, and I didn’t want to leave.

In 2021, I joined [Womp](https://womp.com) as the first design hire. The canvas (pun intended) was wide open. I established the initial patterns, made plenty of mistakes, and learned what it takes to maintain product coherence as a team and user base grow. Titles didn't matter, which is why I still don't know exactly how to describe my role. My work was to bridge disciplines so the product could continue moving forward without losing its shape.

Womp is bigger than any one technology wave. It’s about helping people make 3D things they’re proud of—today, and in the many “todays” that will follow.

## What the work feels like

Most days start with a question—sometimes prompted by a metric, sometimes by a user’s sentence that sticks with me, and sometimes by something my founder wants. I sketch the smallest path to an answer, then bring the right blend of design, code, and product sense to get it in someone’s hands. I really enjoy how the process works: talking to users, working with design to draw rough flows in Figma or V0, shaping a component in code, watching a session, tightening the edges, and repeating. 

However, this is only a small part of my role—this alone is not product. To keep that rhythm steady, I built KookieUI—a design system I forked from Radix and tailored to how we build. It gives us a single place for tokens, states, and interaction rules, so a change to a `Button` or a focus ring rolls out across the product with a version bump, not a scavenger hunt. That separation—design decisions in the system, application logic in the product—lets engineers go deep on performance and data while the interface stays true. This, in turn, frees up my mental space to focus more on product.

## How I lead across the gap

Teams often talk past each other even when aiming for the same outcome. I help bridge those gaps. When a designer says something feels “off” or “clunky,” I can usually spot the subtle interaction causing the friction. When an engineer raises concerns about something being “hard to build” or “fragile,” I can suggest small adjustments in the design to make it easier. When the business pushes for more speed, I help find a way forward that balances shipping quickly with keeping things future-proof.

Ownership is how we stay fast. The person with the context carries the work from idea to live. If a backend change needs a thin UI, platform ships it. If a rendering tweak needs a small panel, a graphics engineer ships it. I lead design reviews, sketch flows, and land the last-mile polish in code so frontend can guard architecture and performance, and designers can stay high on problem-solving instead of chasing pixels. The feeling inside the team is calm: clear owners, quick reviews, tight loops.

## What I’m learning right now

I’m always tuning the balance between momentum and durability. Sometimes the right move is a light, happy-path release to learn whether anyone reaches for it. Sometimes the right move is to slow down and pour concrete under a pattern that keeps returning. Reading those moments—stage, stakes, and team energy—is ongoing work, and I like that it is.

New tools come in waves. Some stick because they change the tempo of building; some don’t. We try things with guardrails, listen harder than we talk, and keep the core experience steady while we explore. Womp’s mission gives us that compass: make creation feel closer, clearer, and more possible for more people.

## What I want to leave behind

I want to leave systems that travel—design tokens that hold together under pressure, component decisions that read like a story, and habits that make good choices easier the next time. I want teammates who understand the “why” well enough to improvise without losing the melody. And I want products that feel more honest the longer you use them.

If I can keep that little “oh” moment alive—often enough, for enough people—then the rest of the job lines up: fewer handoffs, clearer intent, steadier loops, and a product that gets better because we cared about how it feels, not just how it’s built.
