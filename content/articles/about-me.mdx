# About Me

I work at the intersection of design, engineering, and product. That intersection is where most of the hard problems live, and also where the biggest gaps usually show up. It's the messy, complicated space where all three meet, where decisions ripple across teams and where the real impact happens. That's where I've chosen to focus my energy.

## How I Got Here

I studied computer science. I wasn't trained as a designer, but design kept pulling me in — not just the visuals, but the way design shapes how people experience technology. I found myself drawn to the questions that don't have clear answers: How do you make complex systems feel simple? How do you balance what users want with what's technically possible? How do you build something that works today but can evolve tomorrow?

My first real design work was at [Wishbox Studio](https://wishboxstudio.com). It was a small team, and that meant I didn't stay inside one role. I learned to balance business needs with technical constraints, to think about users and deadlines at the same time. That was my first exposure to cross-functional work, and it stuck with me. I realized that the most interesting problems don't respect disciplinary boundaries.

In 2021, I joined [Womp](https://womp.com) as the first design hire. That gave me both responsibility and freedom. I had to establish design practices from scratch, but I also got to experiment. There was no existing design system to follow, no established processes to inherit. I had to figure out how to build something that would work for a team that was growing fast.

Over time I grew into leading design and product, helping the team scale to hundreds of thousands of users. The titles mattered less than the work: bridging between design, engineering, and business so the product could keep moving. I learned that leadership isn't about having all the answers — it's about creating the conditions where good answers can emerge.

## What I Focus On

**Design systems.** I believe systems should outlast projects. Whether it's a design token, a process for making trade-offs, or a communication pattern, I try to leave behind structures that scale. The goal isn't to create perfect systems, but to create systems that make the next decision easier, the next project faster, the next team member more effective.

This is why I built <Flex as="span" direction="row" align="center" gap="1" style={{ display: "inline-flex" }}>KookieUI <Badge highContrast>Coming Soon</Badge></Flex>. It's not just a component library — it's an attempt to codify the design decisions that matter, so they don't get lost in the shuffle of daily work. When spacing is consistent across components, when motion follows the same rules, when accessibility is built in rather than bolted on, the whole product feels more intentional.

**Cross-functional alignment.** I've seen how quickly teams can misinterpret each other. Engineers think designers don't understand constraints. Designers think engineers don't care about user experience. Business folks think everyone else is moving too slowly. My job often ends up being translation: making sure engineers, designers, and business folks are actually talking about the same thing.

This isn't about being a mediator or a diplomat. It's about understanding enough of each discipline to spot the disconnects before they become problems. When an engineer says "this is technically difficult," I can help translate that into design implications. When a designer says "this doesn't feel right," I can help identify the technical constraints that might be causing it.

**Clarity in complexity.** Products don't fail because people aren't smart enough. They fail because problems get too big and too fuzzy. I try to break them down into clear steps so teams can act without losing the bigger picture. This means asking the right questions: What are we actually trying to solve? What's the simplest version that would work? What are the real constraints we're working with?

At [Womp](https://womp.com), this has meant helping the team navigate the complexity of building AI-powered 3D design tools. The technical challenges are real, the user needs are diverse, and the business requirements are constantly evolving. The key is finding ways to make progress without getting lost in the complexity.

**Helping people grow.** I don't want teammates to just execute tasks. I want them to understand the "why" behind decisions, so they can make their own calls next time. This means explaining the reasoning, not just the outcome. It means creating opportunities for people to take on challenges they haven't faced before. It means building systems that make good decisions easier to make.

The goal isn't to create dependencies on me. It's to create a team that can operate effectively even when I'm not in the room. That happens when people understand not just what to do, but why it matters and how to think through similar problems in the future.

## Where I'm Still Learning

I'm not done figuring this out. Every project teaches me something new about how to work at this intersection.

**Balancing speed with quality is still hard.** Sometimes we ship too fast and have to clean up later. Sometimes we spend too much time perfecting something that users don't actually need. The right balance depends on context — what stage the product is in, what the competitive landscape looks like, what the team's capacity is. I'm still learning to read those signals better.

**Leading across disciplines is messy.** I don't always know how much to translate and how much to let people struggle. Sometimes a little friction helps people learn. Sometimes it just creates confusion. The line between helpful guidance and micromanagement isn't always clear, especially when you're working across different skill sets and experience levels.

**Scaling is full of trade-offs.** Every new user brings pressure to solve edge cases, but solving all of them can bloat the product. Every new team member brings new perspectives, but also new communication overhead. Every new feature opens up new possibilities, but also new ways to break things. I'm still learning to navigate these trade-offs without losing sight of what made the product successful in the first place.

These aren't problems I've solved — they're problems I work through every day. The goal isn't to eliminate the messiness, but to get better at working within it.

## Closing

I'm a designer who codes, an engineer who cares about design, and a product lead who tries to keep everything moving. But mostly, I'm someone who's still learning how to do this well.

That's what drives me: solving problems step by step, codifying what works, and sharing enough clarity that the next problem is a little easier to tackle. The intersection of design, engineering, and product isn't a comfortable place to work — it's full of ambiguity and competing priorities. But it's also where the most interesting problems live, and where the biggest impact is possible.

Every day I'm learning something new about how to navigate this space. Every project teaches me something about how to build better systems, how to communicate more effectively, how to help teams move faster without losing quality. The work is never done, but that's what makes it worth doing.
