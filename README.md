## About

I work at the intersection of design, engineering, and product. I learned just enough design to shape the experience, just enough engineering to bring ideas to life, and just enough product thinking to focus on the right problems. That's where the work becomes meaningful and the choices truly matter.

Currently leading product at [Womp](https://womp.com), a 3D design tool that makes 3D accessible to everyone. Previously worked at [Wishbox Studio](https://wishboxstudio.com) as a designer.

## Projects

### Kookie UI ![Alpha](https://img.shields.io/badge/alpha-blue)

A React component library forked from Radix and customized for how we build at Womp. It gives us a single place for tokens, states, and interaction rules, so a change to a Button or a focus ring updates across the product with a version bump.

### Kookie Blocks ![Alpha](https://img.shields.io/badge/alpha-blue)

Higher-level composed components built on Kookie UI. Ship documentation sites, marketing pages, and application interfaces faster with blocks like Hero, CodeBlock, StreamingMarkdown, DocsShell, and more.
